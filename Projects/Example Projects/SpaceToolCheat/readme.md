This is a very simple mod that only adds one new cheat: `addspacetool`.
It allows you to add any tool to your spaceship, searching it by name or by description.

The basic usage is `addspacetool "text"`, where `text` is the text you want to search. If only one tool matches the search, it is added to your spaceship. If more than one tool matches the criteria, it wil show you the list. If you want to add all the tools that match the criteria, then add `-all` to the cheat.

Usage examples:
 - `addspacetool`: shows the list of all available tools.
 - `addspacetool "matter bomb" 20`: adds 20 units of the "Anti-matter Bomb"
 - `addspacetool "atmosphere"`: shows a list of all tools related to the atmosphere.
 - `addspacetool "atmosphere" -all`: adds all the atmospheric tools:
 - `addspacetool "" 10000 -all`: gives you every single space tool, with 10000 ammo each
