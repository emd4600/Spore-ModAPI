///
/// @brief Classes to work with file input/output, that is, reading and writing data into files.
///
/// The main concept of this namespace is that of "streams", which are objects where data can be read form/written into.
/// It's abstract representation is IO::IStream, which defines all the operations you can do to a stream.
/// There are several subclasses to it, depending on the type of stream: use IO::FileStream if you want to write a
/// disk file.
/// Before you can use a stream, you have to call IO::IStream::Open() with the appropriate parameters (it depends on whether you
/// want to create a new file, read or write, etc). AFter you are finished writing, call IO::IStream::Close() so the
/// system releases the stream resources.

/// @namespace IO
///
/// The IO namespace contains classes used to work with file input/output. The IStream interfaces defines the methods needed
/// to read/write a file (not all IStreams support reading/writing). Then there are specific implementations, the most notable of
/// which are:
/// - FileStream: Used for reading files in the file system.
/// - MemoryStream: Used for reading files from the memory.
///
/// The IO namespace itself also contains several methods for reading/writing specific types of data, for example IO::ReadInt32(),
/// IO::WriteUInt(),...
///
/// There's also a class called XmlWriter which can be used to easily write simple files in the XML format.
