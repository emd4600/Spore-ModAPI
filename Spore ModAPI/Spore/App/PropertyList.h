	/// A class that contains multiple properties. This is the representation of a .prop file.
	///
	/// PropertyLists store properties as a map, where an uint32_t (the property ID) is the key, and a Property is the value.
	/// The contents of a Property class vary depending on the property type and flags; therefore, it is recommended that, for
	/// retrieveing values from a property list, you use the static methods defined in the Property class, which are adapted
	/// to get specific types of values.
	///
	/// PropertyLists can have a parent; in that case, properties are also searched recursively in the parents. 
	///
	/// PropertyList inherits from ResourceObject, and therefore, is uniquely identified using a ResourceKey. 
	/// Use the class PropertyManager to get specific lists.
