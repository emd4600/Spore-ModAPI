/// This class represents a basic reference counted object. Reference counted objects can be used inside intrusive_ptr structures
/// in order to have automatic memory management. For example: intrusive_ptr\<Window\> mpWindow = new Window();
///
/// Internally, reference counted objects store a reference count. That value is increased every time AddRef() is called, 
/// and decreased every time Release() is called. When the reference count reaches 0, the object deletes itself.
/// Every AddRef() call must be paired with a Release() call; intrusive_ptr does that automatically.
///
/// However, intrusive pointers must be used carefully, since it could case problems on certain cases.
/// For example, class A has an intrusive_ptr\<B\> member. B has an intrusive_ptr\<A\> that points to the first object. This causes a 
/// recursive dependance that makes those objects never be deleted.
/// 
/// Additionally, this class contains a Cast method, that allows classes to implement
/// an efficient equivalent to dynamic_cast. You can use it directly, but it's recommended to use object_cast instead.
/// For example, to cast an IDrawable\* pDrawable; into a IImageDrawable\*:
/// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
/// // Cast an IDrawable* pDrawable into a IImageDrawable*
/// IImageDrawable* result = object_cast<IImageDrawable>(pDrawable);
/// // If it can be casted it will return nullptr; it's recommend it to always check
/// if (result) ...
/// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
///
/// Object is an interface; for a default implementation, check DefaultObject. 
/// Object can be considered an equivalent to COM objects.
///
/// You can use the "ModAPI Object" item template to create a basic Object class that supports casting.
