namespace Resource
{
	///
	/// IResourceManager is a singleton class used to access resources in Spore's file system.
	///
	/// The main function of the ResourceManager is to access to the resources stored in Spore's files. The manager contains multiple 
	/// IResourceFactory instances, which are assigned to certain typeIDs. When trying to get a resource, those factories will be used
	/// to generate an instance of the correct class according to the resource type. Therefore, the ResourceManager can only be used for those
	/// types that have factories assigned to them.
	/// 
	/// The manager distinguishes two different kinds of type IDs: the *resource type* and the *record type*. Record types are the type IDs
	/// you find in files, such as `.rw4`, `.prop`, etc. Resource types are used to differentiate between different kinds of ResourceObject;
	/// for example, `.raster` and `.rw4` are assigned to the same resource type.
	///
	/// You can assign your own factories or delete existing ones, but if that is not an option, ResourceManager provides a method to find
	/// the Database that contains a certain file. This way, ResourceManager can always be used to get files, either via the GetResource
	/// method or the FindDatabase one. The databases are stored in the resource manager according to their priority.
	///
	/// The manager contains a list of ICache instances that is used to avoid repeteadly creating new instances of a resource that
	/// already exists. The IResourceManager::GetPrivateResource() method can be used instead of IResourceManager::GetResource() to forcibly create a new resource even if it's already
	/// in the cache.
	/// 
	/// This manager provides additional functionality relating files. It keeps a map of ResourceKey - eastl::string16 values, which can be used
	/// to store the original name of certain resources. For example:
	/// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
	/// ResourceManager.SetKeyName(ResourceKey(0x00000000, 0x40212002, 0x0469A3F7), u"ShaderFragments!LowQuality.graphics");
	/// // Now you can access this file using the name we assigned instead of the original name, which had special IDs
	/// ResourceKey dstKey = ResourceManager.GetKeyFromName(u"ShaderFragments!LowQuality.graphics");
	/// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	///
	/// Additionally, the manager also keeps a map of typeID - eastl::string16 values, which allows to map extension eastl::strings to certain typeIDs.
	/// For example:
	/// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
	/// // for example, we could have the mappings on a file and load it on startup
	/// ResourceManager.SetTypename(0x2F7D0004, u"png");
	/// // now, if we try to use the .png extension, we will receive the correct typeID, instead of using the FNV hash of "png" (which is not 0x2F7D0004)
	/// ResourceKey dstKey = ResourceManager.GetFileName(u"MyImages!EditorUIFrame.png");
	/// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	///
