	///
	/// A class derived from EAIOZoneObject is able to be allocated from different 
	/// heaps without the owner of the object needing to know or care which heap
	/// the object came from or even what kind of allocator the object is using.
	/// The owner of the object can use 'delete' or the object can call 'delete'
	/// on itself (useful for reference counting systems) and the object will be 
	/// freed via the correct allocator.
	///
	/// Zone object uses the ICoreAllocator interface to allocate 
	/// and free.
	///
	/// Zone objects have a virtual destructor and thus a vtable. However, the user
	/// doesn't need to use any virtual functions in derived classes.
	///
	/// EAIOZoneObject-deriving classes can be created via EA_NEW, but don't have 
	/// to be created by it. They can be created by regular new as well.
	///
	/// Example usage:
	///     class Widget : public EAIOZoneObject
	///     {
	///         uint32_t mRefCount;
	///
	///         Widget()
	///            : mRefCount(0) { }
	///
	///         void AddRef()
	///             { ++mRefCount; }
	///
	///         void Release()
	///         {
	///             if(mRefCount > 1) 
	///                 --mRefCount;
	///             else
	///                 delete this; // Will use ICoreAllocator to free self.
	///         }
	///     };
	///
	///     Widget* pWidget = new(pCoreAllocator) Widget;
	///     pWidget->AddRef();
	///     pWidget->Release();
