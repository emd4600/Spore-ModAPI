/// @brief The system for accessing file resources stored in .package files.
///
/// This namespace contains all the necessary classes needed for working with file resources stored in .package files.
/// The main class is the IResourceManager, which can be used to get resources from the file system.
/// The resource manager contains a list of Database objects, which can be one of these two:
///  - The DatabasePackedFile represents a .package file that contains resources.
///  - The DatabaseDirectoryFiles represents a plain disk folder, such as the `Games/Game0` folder
///
